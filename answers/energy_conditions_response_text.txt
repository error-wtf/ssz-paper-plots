Response to "Negative Gravitational Energy Density" Criticism

In our SSZ metric we explicitly compute the effective stress-energy of the geometric 
field for a real object (Sgr A*). The plot below shows ρ, p_r and p_⊥ versus r/r_s.

There is a small region near 1.2 r_s where the effective ρ becomes negative and the 
standard energy conditions fail – exactly the "negative gravitational energy" you 
refer to.

But this region is strictly local and bounded: by 10 r_s, ρ is already positive 
again and all energy conditions (WEC, DEC, SEC, NEC) are satisfied, with ρ several 
orders of magnitude below any "cosmic" value.

So the effect is a local property of strong-field geometry, not a universal cosmic 
energy density that hides stellar mass or mimics dark matter.

Key Results from SSZ for Sgr A*:
- At r ≈ 1.2 r_s: ρ ≈ -5.96×10⁻²³ kg/m³ (negative, local effect)
- At r = 10 r_s: ρ ≈ +9.4×10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ (positive, 4 orders smaller)
- At r ≥ 10 r_s: All standard energy conditions satisfied
- Negative energy confined to r < 5 r_s (strong-field region)

This is fundamentally different from a cosmic background that would:
- Extend to infinity
- Have constant or slowly-varying density
- Sum up to observable effects on galactic scales

Our negative energy is:
- Localized near the Schwarzschild radius
- Bounded in extent
- Returns to positive values at modest distances
- Several orders of magnitude too small to affect stellar dynamics

The plot demonstrates this directly.
